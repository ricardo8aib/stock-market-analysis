This project is part of the "Proyecto Aplicado en Anal√≠tica de Datos" course at the University of Los Andes.

## Context

The Stanley Group is one of the most relevant financial conglomerates in Latin America. It presents two main strategic visions, the first is the management of innovation in financial products, and the second is the Money Desk, which is more related to capital market products and has a greater impact on the financial performance of the group, as its current loss situation is around $7 million USD, while for the former, its losses are close to $250 thousand USD.

Among the main financial services managed by the Money Desk are equity investments, asset management, portfolio management, mergers and acquisitions. Regarding performance measures associated with the project, the financial performance of the group (gross margin and profitability), customer satisfaction (positive ratings vs. total ratings), and the turnover rate of human talent should be taken into account, which is related to additional costs due to its management and maintenance.
